/**
 * Searches lrclib.net's public, keyless API for synced (LRC) lyrics matching
 * a track and artist. Results without synced lyrics are filtered out since
 * this app only supports timestamped playback.
 *
 * lrclib's combined track+artist search is strict about the exact artist
 * string it has indexed — a perfectly reasonable artist name (translated,
 * reordered, multiple artists joined with "e"/"&"/"and" instead of however
 * it's stored) can turn up nothing even though the song exists. When that
 * happens, this falls back to a track-only search: the picker UI already
 * shows each result's artist and album, so the player can pick the right
 * match themselves instead of hitting a dead end.
